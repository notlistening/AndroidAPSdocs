# Update to a new version or branch

## New Build System

There is new automated build system which is designed to make generating the latest APK easier.
The new automated build system can be used by new and old users. See the documentation link below for more details.
The original build instructions using Android Studio are still avaiable below and suited to users who want to make modifications to code or who want to build specific versions and branches.

* [Automated Build System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJNcnSZoWIe_9yK0dfx3j6ywk2C1ffREny138ce6I30/edit?usp=sharing) - (Google Docs)
* Manual Builds - see below

<font color="#FF0000"><b>Important note: As of version 2.3 you have to use git to update. Updating via zip file does not work anymore.</font></b>

## Install git (if you don't have it)

### Windows

* Any git version should work. For example [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Make sure to note down the installation path. You will need it in the next step.

   ![Git installation path](../images/Update_GitPath.png)

* Let Studio know where is git.exe located: File - Settings 

   ![Android Studio - open settings](../images/Update_GitSettings1.png)

* In the next window: Version Control - Git

* Choose correct path: .../Git<font color="#FF0000"><b>/bin</b></font>

* Make sure update method "Merge" is selected.

### Mac

* Any git version should work. For example [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* Use homebrew to install git: ```$ brew install git```.
* For details on installing git see the [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
* If you install git via homebrew there is no need to change any preferences. Just in case: They can be found here: Android Studio - Preferences.


## Update your local copy

* Click: VCS->Git->Fetch

   ![Android Studio - GIT - Fetch](../images/Update_Fetch.png)


## Selecting branch

* If you want to change branch select another branch from tray: master (latest release) or another version (please see below)

   ![](../images/UpdateAAPS1.png)

and then checkout (You can use 'Checkout as New Branch' if 'Checkout' is not available.)

   ![](../images/UpdateAAPS2.png)


## Updating branch from Github

* Press Ctrl+T, select Merge method and press OK

   ![](../images/merge.png)

On the tray you'll see green message about updated project

## Generate signed APK
<!--- Text is maintained in page building-apk.md --->
In the menu select "Build" and then "Generate Signed Bundle / APK...". (The menu in Android Studio changed as of September 2018. In older versions select in the menu “Build” and then “Generate Signed APK...”.)<br>
Signing means that you sign your generated app but in a digital way as a kind of digital fingerprint in the app itself. That is necessary because Android has a rule that it only accepts signed code to run for security reasons. For more information on this topic, follow the link [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key) Security is a deep and complex topic and you don't need this now.

![Screenshot 39a](../images/Installation_Screenshot_39a.PNG)

In the following dialogue box select "APK" instead of "Android App Bundle" and click button "Next".

![Screenshot 39b](../images/Installation_Screenshot_39b.PNG)

Select "app" and click "Next".

![Screenshot 40](../images/Installation_Screenshot_40.png)

Enter your key store path, enter key store password, select key alias and enter key password. 

Select 'Remember passwords'.

Then click next.

![Key store path](../images/KeystorePathUpdate.PNG)

Select "full" as flavour for the generated app.
Select V1 "Jar Signature" (V2 is optional) and click "Finish".
The following information might be important for later use.
* 'Release' should be your default choice for "Build Type", 'Debug' is just for people coding.
* Select the build type you want to build. 
  * full (i.e. recommendations automatically enacted in closed looping)
  * openloop (i.e. recommendations given to user to manually enact)
  * pumpcontrol (i.e. remote control for pump, no looping)
  * nsclient (i.e. looping data of another user is displayed and careportal entries can be added)

![Screenshot 44](../images/Installation_Screenshot_44.png)

In the event log you see that the Signed APK was generated successfully.

![Screenshot 45](../images/Installation_Screenshot_45.png)

Click the "locate" link in the event log.

## Transfer APK to smartphone
<!--- Text is maintained in page building-apk.md --->
A file manager window opens. It might look a bit different on your system as I am using Linux. On Windows there will be the File Explorer and on Mac OS X the Finder. There you should see the directory with the generated APK file. Unfortunately this is the wrong place as "wear-release.apk" is not the signed "app" APK we are searching for.

![Screenshot 47](../images/Installation_Screenshot_47.png)

Please change to the directory AndroidAPS/app/full/release to find the "app-full-release.apk" file. Transfer this file to your Android smartphone. You can do it on your preferred way, i.e. Bluetooth, cloud upload, connect computer and phone by cable or use email. I use Gmail here in this example as it is fairly simple for me. I mention this because to install the self-signed app we need to allow Android on our smartphone to do this installation even if this file is received via Gmail which is normally forbidden. If you use something other please proceed accordingly.

![Screenshot 48](../images/Installation_Screenshot_48.png)

In the settings of your smartphone there is an area "unknown apps install" where I have to give Gmail the right to install APK files which I get via Gmail.

Select "Allow from this source". After the installation, you can disable it again.

![Installation from unknown sources](../images/Installation_Screenshot_49-50.png)

The last step is to press on the APK file I got via Gmail and install the app. If the APK does not install and you have an older version of AndroidAPS on your phone that was signed with a different key then you will need to uninstall this first, remember to export your settings if so!

Yeah, you got it and can now start with configuring AndroidAPS for your use (CGMS, insulin pump) etc.


## Check AAPS version on phone

You can check the AAPS version on your phone by clicking the three dots menu on the top right and then about.

![AAPS version installed](../images/Update_VersionCheck.png)


# Troubleshooting

## Kotlin compiler warning

If build completed successfully but you get Kotlin compiler warnings then just ignore these warnings. 

App was build successfully and can be transferred to phone.

![ignore Kotline compiler warning](../images/GIT_WarningIgnore.PNG)

## Could not download… / Offline Work

If you get a failure message like this

![Warning could not download](../images/GIT_Offline1.jpg)

make sure that ‘Offline work’ is disabled.

File -> Settings

![Settings offline work](../images/GIT_Offline2.jpg)

## Uncommitted changes

If you receive failure message like

![Failure uncommitted changes](../images/GIT_TerminalCheckOut0.PNG)

### Option 1

* In Android Studio select VCS -> GIT -> Reset HEAD
   ![Reset HEAD](../images/GIT_TerminalCheckOut3.PNG)
   
### Option 2

* Copy ‘git checkout --’ to clipboard (without quote signs)
* Switch to Terminal in Android Studio (lower left side of Android Studio window)
   ![Android Studio Terminal](../images/GIT_TerminalCheckOut1.PNG)
   
* Paste copied text and press return
   ![GIT checkout success](../images/GIT_TerminalCheckOut2.jpg)

## App not installed

![phone app note installed](../images/Update_AppNotInstalled.png)

* Make sure you have transferred the “app-full-release.apk” file to your phone.
* If "App not installed" is displayed on your phone follow these steps:
  1. [Export settings](../Usage/Objectives#export-import-settings) (in AAPS version already installed on your phone)
  2. Uninstall AAPS on your phone.
  3. Enable airplane mode & turn off bluetooth.
  4. Install new version (“app-full-release.apk”)
  5. [Import settings](../Usage/Objectives#export-import-settings)
  6. Turn bluetooth back on and disable airplane mode

## App installed but old version

If you build the app successfully, transferred it to your phone and installed it successfully but the version number stays the same then you might have missed the merging step in the [update manual](…/Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version.html#updating-branch-from-github).

## None of the above worked

If non of the above tips helped you might consider building the app from scratch:

1.	[Export settings](../Usage/Objectives#export-import-settings) (in AAPS version already installed on your phone)
2.	Have your key password and key store password ready
    In case you have forgotten passwords you can try to find them in project files as described [here](https://youtu.be/nS3wxnLgZOo).
3.	Note down the path to your key store
    In Android Studio Build -> Generate Signed APK
    ![Key store path](../images/KeystorePath.PNG)
 
 4. Build app from scratch as described [here](…/Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.html#download-code-and-additional-components).
     Use existing key and key store.
5.	When you have build the APK successfully delete the exiting app on your phone, transfer the new apk to your phone and install.
6. [Import settings](../Usage/Objectives#export-import-settings)

## Worst case scenario

In case even building the app from scratch does not solve your problem you might want to try to uninstall Android Studio completely. Some Users reported that this solved their problem.

Make sure to uninstall all files associated with Android Studio. Manuals can be found online i.e. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39953495/how-to-completely-uninstall-android-studio-from-windowsv10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39953495/how-to-completely-uninstall-android-studio-from-windowsv10).

Install Android Studio from scratch as described [here](/Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK#install-android-studio) and **do not update gradle**.
